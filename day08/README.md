This is a guessing game. 
The interface is through the buttons and pop-up window,
but pay attention to the notes in the command line. 

Try to guess the number that the computer choose 
When you succeed, you will get a score :

Your score includes the time t and the number of trials counter. For instance: 
-    counter=1, t=1 : score = 100 
-    counter=3, t=10 : score = 96 
-    counter=6, t=12 : score = 70 
-    counter=20, any t : score = 0 
    
so it's important to think fast, but luck and strategy are better!
